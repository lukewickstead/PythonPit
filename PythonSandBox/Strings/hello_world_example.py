# Python has grown in popularity over the years and is today highly regarded as a general-purpose programming language.
# It is used from application development, install/maintenance scripts, OpenStack, REST Web Services
# and Web Application Servers.

# Python is a high level, dynamically typed and interpreted language with capabilities for object orientation.
# It has a very large and extensive standard library and also ships with an interactive command line allow developers

# The Environment

# Python comes pre-installed on Linux, BSD and BSD Copies *dig. If you are running Windows or perhaps would like

#
# Python can be coded in any text editor or a dedicated IDE. There are many available though I personally use
# and recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm). There is a community edition which will provide enough
# functionality for learning the basics of the language.
#
# Features include:
# Running code directly from the IDE
# Interactive Python command line
# Terminal
# Terminal output
# Code Completion
# Code highlighting
# Refactoring
# Code navigation
#
#  API reference and more information on Python can be found at [Python.Org Docs](https://www.python.org/doc).

# Assignment of variables simply requires a variable name and a value. # If the variable does not exists it created it,
# otherwise it resigns the value.

value = "Hello"
print(value)
